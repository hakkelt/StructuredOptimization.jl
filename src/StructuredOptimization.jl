# Bridge ProximalOperators-style `gradient`/`gradient!` to the `value_and_gradient`
# interface ProximalAlgorithms expects. This must accept *any* smooth function this
# package composes and hands to a solver — including arbitrary ProximalOperators
# building blocks (SqrNormL2, Precompose, Postcompose, MoreauEnvelope, …) and this
# package's own wrappers — so it cannot be narrowed to owned types without dropping
# support for problems built from those. It is therefore a deliberate cross-interface
# adaptation (both functions are dependencies of this package); it is listed in the
# Aqua `treat_as_own` allowlist to mark it as intentional rather than accidental
# piracy. ProximalAlgorithms' own `value_and_gradient(::AutoDifferentiable/::Zero, x)`
# methods are more specific, so they still take precedence for those types.
