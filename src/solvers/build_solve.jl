Returns a TermSet containing the optimization variables and the problem terms
to be fed into the solver.

# Candidate term-subsets for one assumption, in the order they are tried.
#
# The selection preference is: absorb as many terms as possible into a single
# assumption (largest subsets first). This is a deterministic score — subsets are
# ranked by `(size, powerset-position)` — so a fixed problem always parses the same
# way regardless of external iteration order. Enumerating `powerset` largest-first
# reproduces the historical `reverse(collect(powerset(...)))` order exactly, keeping
# `parse_problem`/`suggest_algorithm`/`print_diagnostics` behavior stable.

# What a term subset costs an assumption, in the units of `best_formulation`: the sum over
# its terms of the cheapest formulation the assumption can actually use.
#
# This is the scoring half of the two-layer search. It reads only the *unexpanded* term
# operator — a field access — and the trait predicates, so it neither builds an operator nor
# touches an array; the whole score of a problem costs a few dozen type queries against the
# thousands of operator applications of the optimization pass it selects.

"""
    match_assumption(assumption, remaining_terms, variables)

Consume a subset of `remaining_terms` with `assumption`, returning
`(preparation_result, matched_terms)` or `nothing` when no subset satisfies it.

Every subset that prepares is scored and the best one is taken, rather than the first one
that happens to work. The key is

    (-length(subset), selection_cost(assumption, subset), position in the powerset)

so the primary preference is still "absorb as many terms as possible into one assumption",
the formulation cost decides between subsets of equal size, and the historical
powerset position breaks a remaining tie — which makes the result deterministic and
reproduces the previous first-match choice wherever the costs tie.

Scoring the two layers together is the point: a cheaper formulation is only better if the
algorithm that gets selected can use it, which is why `selection_cost` asks `assumption`
what it needs rather than ranking formulations on their own.

Enumeration is pruned rather than exhaustive. `candidate_term_subsets` yields subsets
largest-first, so `-length(subset)` is non-decreasing: once a subset of size `k` has
prepared, no smaller subset can beat it and the search stops at the end of that size class.
