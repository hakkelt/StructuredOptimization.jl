# squared L2 norm (times a constant, or weighted) precomposed with an operator

"""
    SqrNormL2WithNormalOp(L::AbstractOperator, λ=1)

With a nonnegative scalar `λ`, return the squared Euclidean norm
```math
f(x) = \\tfrac{λ}{2σ}\\|L * x\\|^2,
```
where `σ` is the adjoint scaling of `L` described below (`σ = 1`, and the factor disappears,
whenever `L'` is the true adjoint of `L`).
With a nonnegative array `λ`, return the weighted squared Euclidean norm
```math
f(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2σ}∑_i λ_i y_i^2 where y = L * x.
```

This is a special case of the more general `Precompose(SqrNormL2(), L, 1, 0)` operator,
where `L` is a linear operator, and only the gradient is needed, not the proximal operator.
The gradient of the precomposed squared norm is
```math
\\nabla f(x) = Lᴴ * L * x,
```
and in many cases, there is an optimized implementation of the normal operator `Lᴴ * L`
that makes the computation of the gradient much faster than the naive implementation.

`L` may be affine (an `AffineAdd`, as produced by `ls(A*x - b)`): writing `L*x = A*x + d`,
the normal operator carries the displacement `Aᴴd` automatically (`Lᴴ*L*x = AᴴA*x + Aᴴd`
when `L*0 = d`), so `gradient!` computes the correct gradient in a single pass.

`gradient!` returns the function value `f(x)`, as `ProximalCore.value_and_gradient!`
requires, recovered from the gradient without a second application of `L`.

# Adjoint scaling

`L'` is not always the true adjoint of `L`. A `BACKWARD`-normalized DFT, for instance, has
`L' = L⁻¹ = Lᴴ/N`: the pair is off by a positive scalar `σ` defined by
```math
\\mathrm{Re}⟨L u, L u⟩ = σ \\, \\mathrm{Re}⟨u, (L'L) u⟩ .
```
Since `Lᴴ*L*x` (as actually computed from `L'*L`) is then `1/σ` times the true gradient of
`f`, the value returned alongside it must be scaled the same way for the two to be
consistent — otherwise anything that reads both (a backtracking line search, a printed
objective) is meaningless. `σ` is measured once, at construction, with a single probe
through `L` and `L'L`; with a genuine adjoint it is `1` and every formula above reduces to
the usual one.

Return `Lᴴ * L` for a *linear* `L` when that product *fuses* into a single operator, and
`nothing` when it stays the two-pass `Compose(Lᴴ, L)`.

This is the applicability test for `SqrNormL2WithNormalOp`: folding `L` into the function
only pays off when the normal operator is cheaper than applying `L` and then `Lᴴ`, which is
exactly when `Lᴴ * L` collapses — a `MatrixOp` into its Gram matrix, a `DiagOp` into the
squared diagonal, an FFT-based convolution into a single multiplication in the frequency
domain, or whatever specialised product a downstream package defines for its own operator
type. A `Compose` means no such product exists, so the fold would add the value-recovery
bookkeeping without saving a pass.

Fusing is not on its own enough to make the normal operator the cheaper of the two, so `L`
must also map into a codomain at least as large as its domain (see
[`normal_op_worthwhile`](@ref)).

`L` must carry no displacement; [`with_normal_op`](@ref) re-attaches it to the result.

Whether it is worth even *trying* to replace `L` by its normal operator: `L` has to be
linear, not already the identity, and map into a codomain at least as large as its domain.

The last condition is what rules out an underdetermined `L`. `LᴴL` acts on the domain, so
applying it costs on the order of `prod(size(L, 2))^2` against the `2·prod(size(L, 1))·
prod(size(L, 2))` of applying `L` and then `Lᴴ` — the normal operator only wins once the
domain is the smaller of the two spaces. Forming it also squares the condition number, and
on a wide `L` that is paid for nothing. A least-squares term over several variables is the
usual way to end up wide, since its domain is the sum of the blocks' domains.

    normal_op_fuses(L::AbstractOperator)

Whether `Lᴴ * L` fuses into a single operator, decided **from the types alone**.

This is the scoring-time counterpart of [`fused_normal_op`](@ref), which answers the same
question by building the product — for a `MatrixOp` that means forming the Gram matrix,
`O(n²m)`, more work than several iterations of the solver the score is meant to select.
`best_formulation` may only call this one; `fused_normal_op` is reached once, for the
candidate that wins.

The answer comes from type inference on `adjoint` and `*`, so nothing is constructed. It is
deliberately conservative: an inference result of `Any` (or `Union{}`) counts as *not*
fusing, so an operator whose product cannot be predicted is scored as the generic linear
case. Being conservative here costs at worst a suboptimal-but-correct formulation, never a
wrong one — and `merge_function_with_operator` falls back to `Precompose` if the optimistic
direction ever turns out wrong.
