# `ls` can only fold the operator into the function for a single-variable expression (a
# multi-variable normal-op term would collapse its variables into one operator domain and
# could no longer be combined with other terms). The same rewrite is therefore retried in
# `merge_function_with_operator`, where the operator has already been expanded to the
# problem's full domain and is composed with nothing afterwards — so a multi-variable term
# gets the normal-operator gradient after all, provided the joint normal operator both
# fuses and is the cheaper of the two formulations.
